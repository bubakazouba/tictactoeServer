define a game type for the Game object, let the Games object be able to handle all game types
listenForNewTTTPlayers will have to have a dict of queues ["gametype"]=queue, so it has a queue for every game type, so it knows how to connect players together

make sure player doesn't play with himself

add a "msg" field for all packets specifying what they do.

write a doc for all server/client interactions with the specific keys for every request

when a client disconnects: remove from memory the values in dictionaries (like sentACKS[addressPortTuple]=[]) delete all of these from memory
